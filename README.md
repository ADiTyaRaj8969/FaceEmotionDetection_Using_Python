### 😊 Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection

This project performs **real-time emotion detection** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model and **OpenCV**. It detects human facial expressions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, and more from webcam video input 🎥 and displays a live stats overlay including FPS and detected emotions.
